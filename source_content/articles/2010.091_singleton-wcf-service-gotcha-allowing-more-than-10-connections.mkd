title: Singleton WCF service gotcha: allowing more than 10 connections
labels: .NET, WCF

By default, an instance of a WCF service can only have 10 connections at a time.  If your service is a singleton then there is obviously only one instance, which means that only 10 clients can connect to your service at a time.  All subsequent connection attempts will result in timeouts if one of the 10 spots is not freed up.  You can easily change this from the default by adding a <code>serviceThrottling</code> entry to your <code>behavior</code> definition in the app.config/web.config file.  Here's an example that cranks the max up to 50<!--break-->:

	<serviceThrottling maxConcurrentCalls="100" maxConcurrentSessions="50" maxConcurrentInstances="50" />
