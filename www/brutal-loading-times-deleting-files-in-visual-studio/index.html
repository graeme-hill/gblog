<p>I have long had an issue with Visual Studio where it takes a ridiculous amount of time to delete a file.  Sometimes it takes over a minute and the IDE is completely unusable while it is loading.  I finally came across a <a href="http://mhinze.com/slow-file-delete-visual-studio/" target="_new">this post</a> by Matt Hinze that gives a solution.  Apparently when you delete a file it scans your recycle bin which can take a long time if there are lot of files in there.  All you have to do is empty your recycle bin and you should be able to delete files with no noticeable delay.</p>
