<p>VB.NET has the sometimes useful feature of late binding, but this seems to lead to poor code.  By default, late binding is enabled (ie: <code>Option Strict</code> is set to <code>Off</code>) allowing for implicit narrowing conversions (no cast).  Although there are certainly cases where this is a useful feature that can cut down on the amount of reflection code left up to the programmer, I have found that it is more often a cause of less robust code and needless performance degradation<!--break-->.</p>

<p>With <code>Option Strict Off</code> we can write code like this:</p>

<pre lang="VB">
    Dim obj As Object = "Hello, World!"
    Dim str As String = obj
</pre>

<p>In this case the code will run just fine, and it saved us the hassle of casting <code>obj</code> to <code>String</code>.  However, we will obviously run into problems in a situation like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim obj As Object = "Hello, World!"
Dim int As Integer = obj
</code></pre>

<p>Even though <code>int</code> is an <code>Integer</code> this code will compile, but at runtime there will be an <code>InvalidCastException</code>.  This is all pretty simple stuff, but the bottom line is that in this case, <code>Option Strict Off</code> gives a runtime error, while <code>Option Strict On</code> gives a compile error.  The value of compile-time errors should not be taken lightly, and in my humble opinion they are a programmer's best friend.  With <code>Option Strict On</code> our first sample only needs a minor change:</p>

<pre><code>Dim obj As Object = "Hello, World!"
Dim str As String = DirectCast(obj, String)
</code></pre>

<p>Was it really that difficult just to cast it?  Type casting is not an inconvenience, but a necessary precaution requiring the programmer to say to the compiler: "Yes, I did intend to perform a narrowing conversion.  It was not an accident".</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, I like to set <code>Option Strict On</code> as the project default (go to Project -> Properties -> Compile) and then add <code>Option Strict Off</code> to code files that require it rather than the other way around.</p>
