title: Converting from svn to git: another reason not to use external references
labels: Git, SVN

Usually it is easy to import a subversion repository into git.  You just do this<!--break-->:

	mkdir my_project
	cd my_project
	git svn init svn://repo.url/goes/here
	git svn fetch

This will always fetch the repository you specified, but sometimes in svn your project actually depends on multiple repositories (ie: you use external references).  The external reference will not be fetched and you will have to manually add it in somehow.

Did you really think it would be that easy?
