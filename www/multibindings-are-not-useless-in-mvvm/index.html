labels: .NET, MVVM, WPF</p>

<p>Lately I have been detecting a growing sentiment that any use of MultiBinding is poor practice in MVVM (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/wpf-disciples/browse_thread/thread/99a59fecec962376?pli=1">this thread</a> on WPF disciples for example).  However, I think people who say you should <em>never</em> use MultiBinding are missing its point.  It is probably better to make a single binding to a FullName property than to multi bind to FirstName and LastName and then convert it into a full name.  But there is still a scenario that demands the use of MultiBinding: <strong>bindings that need to update when more than one UI property changes</strong>.  MultiBindings are not just used for passing more information to the converter, they also specify when the value needs to be updated and call the converter again.  This is a much more important feature and it requires MultiBinding. </p>
