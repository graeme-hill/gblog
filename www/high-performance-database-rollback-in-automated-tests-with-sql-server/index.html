		<p>title: High performance database rollback in automated tests with SQL Server

<p>A couple months ago I wrote <a href="http://graemehill.ca/unit-testing-an-entity-framework-data-access-layer-part-1-just-hit-the-database">this</a> article explaining why I think it is reasonable for unit tests to hit a real database.  Subsequently, I wrote a <a href="http://graemehill.ca/unit-testing-an-entity-framework-data-access-layer-part-2-rolling-back-the-test-database">follow up article</a> describing some techniques for rolling back your database to its original state after each test.  In that article I found that just using simple transactions did not solve the problem because you need access to all database connections being used, and they all have to be rolled back.  I have since found a way around this problem using distributed transactions<!--break-->.</p>

<p>With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Transaction_Coordinator">Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator</a> (MSDTC) the activity over multiple connections can be lumped into a single transaction using the <code>TransactionScope</code> class.  MSDTC needs to be running for this to work, but since this is just for unit tests it doesn't need to be enabled on your production environment.</p>

<p>In order to use the <code>TransactionScope</code> class your project will need a reference to <code>System.Transactions</code>.  Here's a sample unit test using MSTest and Entity Framework where the database is altered with multiple connections within a transaction and then the changes are rolled back:</p>

<pre><code>Imports System.Transactions
Imports System
Imports System.Text
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting

&lt;TestClass()&gt; _
Public Class UnitTestSample

    &lt;TestMethod()&gt; _
    Public Sub ProofOfConceptTest()
        Using New TransactionScope
            Dim conn1 As New DataTestEntities
            Dim conn2 As New DataTestEntities

            Dim row1 As New Users With {.userName = "user1", .password = "pass"}
            Dim row2 As New Users With {.userName = "user2", .password = "pass"}

            conn1.AddToUsers(row1)
            conn2.AddToUsers(row2)

            conn1.SaveChanges()
            conn2.SaveChanges()

            Dim conn3 As New DataTestEntities
            Assert.AreEqual(conn3.Users.Count, 6)
        End Using
    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you want every test method inside a test class to be within its own <code>TransactionScope</code> without adding a <code>Using</code> block to every single test, you can use the initialization and cleanup methods like this:</p>

<pre><code>Imports System.Transactions
Imports System
Imports System.Text
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting

&lt;TestClass()&gt; _
Public Class UnitTestSample

    Private _transaction As TransactionScope

    &lt;TestInitialize()&gt; _
    Public Sub Setup()
        _transaction = New TransactionScope
    End Sub

    &lt;TestCleanup()&gt; _
    Public Sub TearDown()
        _transaction.Dispose()
    End Sub

    &lt;TestMethod()&gt; _
    Public Sub ProofOfConceptTest()
        Dim conn1 As New DataTestEntities
        Dim conn2 As New DataTestEntities

        Dim row1 As New Users With {.userName = "user1", .password = "pass"}
        Dim row2 As New Users With {.userName = "user2", .password = "pass"}

        conn1.AddToUsers(row1)
        conn2.AddToUsers(row2)

        conn1.SaveChanges()
        conn2.SaveChanges()

        Dim conn3 As New DataTestEntities
        Assert.AreEqual(conn3.Users.Count, 6)
    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the use of MSDTC is an option, I have found this method to be far better than any of those described in the <a href="http://graemehill.ca/unit-testing-an-entity-framework-data-access-layer-part-2-rolling-back-the-test-database">last article</a>.  It guarantees that the state or your database is maintained and is extremely fast (at least on small amounts of data).</p>
