<p>The title of this article is a pretty obvious statement, but it's actually pretty easy to forget and it can lead to some painful bugs.  Here's a code snippet whose output may seem surprising<!--break-->:</p>

<pre><code>Module Module1

    Sub Main()
        Dim query = 
            From name In {"one", "two", "three"}
            Select New User(name)

        Dim x = query.First
        Dim y = query.First

        Console.WriteLine(x Is y)

        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub

End Module

Public Class User
    Public Sub New(ByVal username As String)
        Console.WriteLine("Creating user: " &amp; username)
    End Sub
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance it looks like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the same object, but since <code>query</code> is just a query, not an actual collection, the result will be fetched independently each time you call <code>First</code>.  When the code is run, the console output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Creating user: one
Creating user: one
False
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that the constructor was called twice for the same string, which explains why <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are actually different objects.  In a case like this it is better to put <code>ToList</code> at the end of the query:</p>

<pre><code>Dim users =
    (From name In {"one", "two", "three"}
     Select New User(name)).ToList()
</code></pre>

<p>Bugs like this can be particularly problematic when you pass around an object of type <code>IEnumerable</code> and the programmer assumes that they are dealing with a collection, when they are really dealing with a query.  So... watch out!</p>
