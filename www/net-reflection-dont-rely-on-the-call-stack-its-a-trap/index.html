labels: .NET, C#, VB.NET</p>

<p>In recent memory I have twice tried to write reflection code that seemed totally badass at the time but turned out to be just plain bad.  One case involved the use of <code>GetCallingAssembly()</code> and the other involved navigating the stack trace with <code>stackTrace.GetFrame(1)</code>.  While there is nothing inherently wrong with these functions (ie: they can be used perfectly fine for logging or debugging) you absolutely cannot depend on a specific result due to runtime optimizations by the .NET JIT compiler.  For example<!--break-->, imagine A calls B and B calls C. If C runs <code>GetCallingAssembly()</code> then you would expect to get the assembly of B; however, if function B gets inlined in A (which is not uncommon) then technically A is directly calling C, and you will actually get A as a result!  In fact, if you check the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getcallingassembly.aspx">MSDN documentation</a> they even warn you about this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the method that calls the GetCallingAssembly method is expanded inline by the just-in-time (JIT) compiler, or if its caller is expanded inline, the assembly that is returned by GetCallingAssembly may differ unexpectedly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documentation for <code>GetExecutingAssembly()</code> has no such warning, but just to be safe I prefer to be explicit with something like this: <code>myObject.GetType().Assembly</code></p>
