A few months ago I wrote <a href="http://graemehill.ca/nullable-combo-boxes-in-wpf">this article</a> on making a nullable combo box control in WPF.  I had a bunch of requests to see an actual implementation, so <a href="http://graemehill.ca/samples/WpfNullableComboBox.zip">here</a> is a sample Visual Studio 2008 project with the source code for the user control.  It basically uses the same technique I described in my previous blog post.  All the combo box properties (even the obscure ones no one will ever use) are implemented.
