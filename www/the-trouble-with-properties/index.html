		<p>title: The trouble with properties
labels: .NET, C#</p>

<p>Properties are supposed to provide encapsulation for your getter and setter logic, but they really don't enforce it.  Here's what I mean<!--break-->:</p>

<pre><code>private String _title;

public String Title
{
    get
    {
        // do custom getter stuff here
        return _title;
    }
    set
    {
        // do custom setter stuff here
        _title = value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The private field <code>_title</code> is the <em>backing store</em> for the property <code>Title</code>.  The issue is that I don't want to manually create this backing store, and I <em>really</em> don't want it to be available anywhere in the class.  I want to force anyone who edits this class to modify the value using the property, not the backing store.  You don't have to create a backing store with a default property like this:</p>

<pre><code>public String Title { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>This is convenient, but it beats the point entirely.  I specifically want to avoid the backing store when I have custom logic in either the getter or the setter.  Currently in C# and VB (and every other language I can think of for that matter) there is no way to force the use of the property internally.  I think it would be ideal to have an automatic backing store that is only accessible within the getter and setter.</p>

<p>Am I crazy?</p>
